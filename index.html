            <p>
                I'm a student in Web Development capable in web development and design. I graduate in the spring of
                2020, and I've gained a wide range of skills over the course of my degree.
                I'm familiar with web markup, scripting, and programming, as well as database programming and
                structures, hosting, and cloud platforms. I'm based in North Carolina, and am
                currently studying at Durham Tech.

                    <a href="https://github.com/knoxd8256" target="_blank">This is my GitHub page.</a> I've got a few
                    code snippets on here,
                    as well as the source code for this website. Many of the oddly-named or seemingly incomplete
                    projects are small assignments for my classes, and only serve to demonstrate mastery of a given
                    skill.

                    <a href="https://johntheartist.net" target="_blank">This is a website I built for my dad.</a> He's
                    an artist, and wanted a
                    place he could link people to so they could see a few examples of his art. It's still a bit of a
                    work in progress, but it's coming along slowly but surely.

                        nursery.</a>
                    I manage the real website for Morningsong, and have rewritten pieces of it here, without the use of
                    WIX,
                    which was set up by the previous webmaster.

                        Design class.</a> It is a
                    relatively basic static site, but demonstrates several interesting implementations of CSS
                    properties, grid, and a Javascript nav button.
