                Here are a few links to projects and websites I have worked on, as well as to my GitHub profile, where
                you can find more projects and code snippets.

                    <a href="github.com/knoxd8256">This is my GitHub page.</a> I've got a few code snippets on here,
                    as well as the source code for this website. Many of the oddly-named or seemingly incomplete
                    projects are small assignments for my classes, and only serve to demonstrate mastery of a given
                    skill.

                <p>
                    <a href="johntheartist.net">This is a website I built for my dad.</a> He's an artist, and wanted a
                    place he could link people to so they could see a few examples of his art. It's still a bit of a
                    work in progress, but it's coming along slowly but surely.

                <p>
                    <a href="/portfolio/nursery/index.html">This is a rewrite of the website of a home nursery.</a>
                    I manage the real website for Morningsong, and have rewritten pieces of it here, without the use of WIX,
                    which was set up by the previous webmaster.

                <h3>Varsity</h3>
                <p>
                    <a href="portfolio/varsity/index.html">This is a website I'm working on as practice.</a> The real website for the Varsity,
                    <a href="http://varsityonfranklin.com">varsityonfranklin.com</a>, is quite deprecated. Because of this, I found it to be
                    good practice to rewrite it with a modern approach to design, without losing the original aesthetic of the site.
