            <h2>About the Site</h2>
            <p> 
                This site is the answer to what every new player asks: What does any of this actually <em>mean?</em>
                Dungeons and Dragons is more user-friendly than every with the advent of Fifth Edition, but at the 
                end of the day there are a lot of terms and basics which experienced players and dungeon masters take for granted.
                This site aims to answer all of the above in a friendly, understandable fashion.

            <h2>About the Author</h2>
            <p>
                I'm a student, a web designer, a D&D player, and a Dungeon Master. I've been playing D&D for as long as I
                can remember, and have played every edition except for 3.5 (because sometimes self-care is opting out
                of a broken system). I built this site over a couple of months, with several complete teardowns and rebuilds.
                My hope is that it will serve as a useful resource in the future.
