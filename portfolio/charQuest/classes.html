            <h2>Classes</h2>
            <p>
                Classes are the basic definition of what a character's function in the game is. One can think of it like
                a character's job within the adventure, albeit with a much wider range of consequences. Each class has
                a particular specialization which defines what they are good at, what they struggle with, and how they
                interact with the world.

            <h2>Fighter</h2>
            <p> 
                A fighter is what we typically think of as a medieval adventurer. Strong, fierce, and unstoppable,
                this class is all about attack strength in both attack and defense, making use of the strength and
                constitution scores extensively. Fighters are generally considered to be an all-round class which is 
                able to function in almost any setting. A great class for a beginner character without a lot of the bells
                and whistles which come with more complex classes.

            <h2>Ranger</h2>
            <p>
                Rangers are the in-between of fighters and rogues, acting as archers, close combat fighters, and 
                utility characters. Due to their ability to adapt to almost any situation, rangers are great for the
                player who wants to try it all. With spells, practical skills, and a variety of fighting styles,
                a good ranger can be what separates a good party from a great one.

            <h2>Cleric</h2>
            <p>
                Clerics are the primary healers in the D&D universe, and access those healing powers via connection to
                a deity, faith, or alignment which gives them strength. Clerics are characterized as priests, and as
                such have more limitations than many other classes, but can be one of the most powerful classes when
                played properly. Being arguably the most essential supporting class, the cleric is good for the player
                who wants to begin exploring magic-users while still playing a support role in the party.

            <h2>Rogue</h2>
            <p>
                Rogues are the thieves and assassins of the party, and tend to be a choice for more 'solo players.'
                Despite this, rogues can work excellently with a team to utilize stealth and surprise to turn the tide
                of a battle in the favor of their group. Rogues are heavy users of the dexterity stat, and are excellent 
                for situations which require finesse and secrecy.

            <h2>Bard</h2>
            <p>
                Bards are musicians, artists, magicians, and entertainers. Diplomatic and skilled in the more 'person oriented'
                tasks of persuasion and social prowess, bards play an important part in navigating the less battle-heavy parts
                of an adventure. Don't be fooled, though. A bard's inspiration can boost the abilities of their teammates, and
                give the party the edge they need to win fights, in addition to casting powerful magic to cripple and even 
                entirely dispatch enemies on the battlefield.

            <h2>Paladin</h2>
            <p>
                If the cleric is the priest of the D&D world, the palading is the righteous crusader, spreading good throughout
                the land and vanquishing evil wherever it may reside. Paladins are incredibly powerful fighters, specializing
                in taking heavy amounts of damage for their teammates and performing small miracles to heal themselves and their
                party. Serving as the holy shield of their fellow party members, these crusaders are powerful support characters
                and not to be taken lightly.

            <h2>Barbarian</h2>
            <p>
                Barbarians are just about what they sound like. Brutish and powerful, barbarians favor heavy, slow attacks and raw
                power over the more nuanced methods of the fighters and rangers, while maintaining a fighting spirit which has
                no rival. Able to enter a berserker rage, these characters are not as steadfast as fighters, but make up for it in
                boosted attack power.

            <h2>Monk</h2>
            <p>
                Monks are the martial artists who utilize hand-to-hand and basic weapon attacks to take down an enemy quickly and 
                decisively. Heavily trained and disciplined to the core, monks are difficult to play but powerful when used correctly,
                able to take down powerful enemies with a few well-placed strikes. Although monks stray away from traditionally powerful
                weapons like swords and daggers, their skill with martial arts more than makes of for the lack of gear.

            <h2>Druid</h2>
            <p>
                Druids are connected to the earth in a more integral way than other classes, protecting and fighting for the natural
                world in much the same way that a cleric or paladin would for their faith. Able to cast nature-based spells and communicate
                with plants and animals, the druid is a formidable fighter when challenged. 
            </p>

            <h2>Magic-Users</h2>
            <p>
                There are three primary classes of magic-users: Sorcerer, Wizard, and Warlock. While each has their strengths and weaknesses,
                the differences are not great enough to be explored in separate passages. All three cast magic in order to perform attacks
                and raise teh defenses and statistics of their parties, and tend to be less physically powerful than their fighter counterparts.
                Not for the casual player, these classes require a great amount of record-keeping in order to keep track of their wide range
                of spells and abilities, which recharge after periods of rest.
