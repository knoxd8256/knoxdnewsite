            <h2>Equipment</h2>
            <p> 
                While the basic stats of a character can be very important, what gives
                a player more on-the-fly flexibility and customization as they work their
                way through an adventure is the wide array of equipment which can be picked
                up, created, and/or bought. Although the class and ability scores are fixed
                as long as that character is alive (with a few notable exceptions), the
                equipment they wear and use can change rapidly, and are sought after due 
                to the power they allow.

            <h2>Common Examples</h2>
            <p>
                Equipment can be anything, from a sword to a helmet to a sidepouch for carrying
                items. Equipment largely settles into a few basic categories: Armor, Weapons, and
                everything else. Armor raises your armor class (AC), and makes it more difficult
                to hit. Other things which affect your AC could be spells or abilities, but armor
                is the most basic way to improve that score. Weapons, on the other hand, increase
                the power you have available to attack with. Every weapon has listed a damage roll
                and which modifiers you can add to that roll. The higher the roll, the higher the damage.
                Other types of equipment include ammunition, potions, food, and utilities such as rope
                or side packs.
