            <h2>Flavor Text</h2>
            <p> 
                Flavor text is what makes roleplaying games interesting and unique in nature.
                Without it, they become a simple array of numbers and stats. Flavor text is genereally known to be any text which does not directly
                affect the mechanics of the game (i.e. the numbers and how they interact with each other). For example, there are many spells which
                can be cast in order to deal flame damage, but what makes each unique is the descriptions which accompany them. While firebolt is described
                more like a crossbow bolt made of flames, the spell Fireball is known to be a ball of fire which shoots forward and expands.

            <h2>Flexibility</h2>
            <p>
                What truly makes flavor text unique and useful as a worldbuilding and storytelling tool is how it can be used flexibly without breaking the
                base portions of the game. In character building, this can be used to make one's character truly special. In the example of John the Fighter,
                some flavor text might include his aspirations, his personal strengths, and his eye color. While some aspects such as his main goals might 
                affect how he interacts with the in-game world, his eye color will likely have little bearing on the rest of the game.
