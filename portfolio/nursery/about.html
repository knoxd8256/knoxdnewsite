    <h3>Joya Matza, Lead Teacher/Founder</h3>
    <p>I love children!  For the past 20 years or so I have had the honor to work with and alongside children. Morning Song is my hearts work! I believe with all my heart that children learn by doing, exploring, helping one another, collaborating and playing. I strive to foster a love of learning through creativity, magic and wonder. <br />
      <br />
      I have completed my Associates Degree in Early Childhood Education and continue to attend workshops, classes, and lectures in early childhood. I also completed a medical assistant training program and worked with children in hospital settings. I was raised in NY, and have lived in Boston, Oregon and Hawaii while working in many fields of early childhood.  My love of nature, animals, and the seasons allows me to enliven the children’s natural connection to these elements of life.<br />
      <br />
      While in Hawaii, I worked at the Haleakala Waldorf School as a Kindergarten Assistant and then as a Co-Teacher.  After my children were born I started the Rainbow Playgroup which was Waldorf inspired, and evolved into a home based nursery. <br />
	  <br />
		As a mother of two children (now young adults!) and with many years of experience in teaching young children, I am delighted to have the opportunity to witness, guide, and have fun with your children. <br />
		<br />
		It is my hope that you and your child’s time at Morning Song is very joyful and that your child develops in a healthy positive way. If you have any suggestions or questions, do not hesitate to contact me.  I look forward to working with you in the care of your child.
