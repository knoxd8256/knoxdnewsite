    <h1>Welcome to Morning Song!</h1>
    <h2>Where the magic of learning and fairy-tale wonder of being a child is preserved</h2>
    <p>Morning Song is a home based play group for children 2 1/2  through 5 1/2 years of age, inspired by the natural world and the philosophy of Waldorf education. Morning Song meets Monday through Thursday mornings from 9:00am - 1:00pm with enrollment options for a 3 or 4 day program. Slumber Garden is offered from 1pm to 5pm. <br />
      <br />
      Morning Song provides a child's first step from their home to another nurturing, yet structured home environment that is play based. Waldorf education emphasizes the importance of play to develop the child's imagination in the early years. As young children learn primarily through imitation - by seeing and doing, the teacher influences children through example. Love and goodness, cooperation and sharing, warmth, security and trust are all expressed, modeled and encouraged.<br />
      <br />
      The Morning Song day is a balance of group and individual activities, both inside and outside, that provide a healthy and secure rhythm for the children. There are special activities for each day such as painting with watercolors, craft making, and bread baking. A vegetarian, organic snack is served each day. Natural, homemade toys invite imaginative play. The yearly rhythm comes alive through seasonal activities, storytelling, and festivals. I aim to create an environment of beauty and goodness through colors, natural toys and materials. </p>
