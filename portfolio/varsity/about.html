  <p>The Varsity Theatre has been a landmark of Chapel Hill and Franklin Street for over 50 years. Since the Sorrell building was built in 1927, it has always housed a movie theater, starting with the original Carolina Theater and then the Village Theater before becoming home to the Varsity. <br>
    <br>
    As the new owners, we have made cosmetic improvements that give the theater an old time feel as well as allow the landmark space to be utilized for social gatherings and parties. <br>
    <br>
    We feel it is an honor to continue the tradition of the Varsity Theatre and think that the improvements made thus far as well as our focus on customer service will make the theater a destination in downtown Chapel Hill for movies as well as hosting social events, birthday parties and private gatherings.<br>
